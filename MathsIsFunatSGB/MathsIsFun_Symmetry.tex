\begin{abstract}
    Symmetry is encountered everywhere - in nature, engineering, arts, and science. Symmetry has widely been used by all the modern sciences. So principles of symmetry dominate in physics and mathematics, chemistry and biology, engineering and architecture, painting and sculpture, poetry and music. Now then, what is symmetry? What profound idea under lies the concept? Why does symmetry literally permeate the entire world around us?
